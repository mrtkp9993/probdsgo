# Probabilistic Data Structures in Go

*Work in progress*

This repository contains implementations of probabilistic data structures in Go.

## Feature Roadmap

- [ ] Hash functions
    - [x] Murmur3 (32-bit)
    - [x] FNV1 (64-bit)
- [ ] Membership
    - [x] Bloom filter
    - [ ] Quotient filter
    - [X] Cuckoo filter
- [ ] Cardinality
    - [ ] HyperLogLog
- [ ] Frequency
    - [ ] Count-min sketch
- [ ] Rank
    - [ ] q-digest
    - [ ] t-digest
- [ ] Similarity
    - [ ] Locality-sensitive hashing

Thread-safe and optimized implementations will be added in the future.
